# RAHomebrew
Freely available games with RetroAchievements sets.
This fork will try to update televandalist's initial attempt at archiving these games. The filenames of every game will be the same as the ones shown in their respective Supported Game Files page (with a few exceptions/fixes where needed). File extensions will not be changed unless the ROMs that use it cannot be loaded into the proper emulator (eg I cannot load touhou.bas in Stella but I can load touhou.bas.bin).

If any problems occur with any of the ROMs listed here (eg incorrect hash) or if you want to add extra games, feel free to make an issue! (for the latter, remember that they must be in this hub: https://retroachievements.org/hub/22750)
