# RAHomebrew
Freely available games on RetroAchievements.
This fork updates televandalist's initial attempt at archiving these kinds of games. The filenames of every game will be the same as the ones shown in their respective Supported Game Files page (with a few exceptions/fixes where I think it looks nice). File extensions will not be changed unless the ROMs that use it cannot be loaded into their proper RA-supported emulator (eg I cannot load touhou.bas in RetroArch/(RA)Libretro's Stella core but I can load touhou.bas.bin in it just fine).

If any problems occur with any of the ROMs listed here (e.g. an incorrect hash) or if you want to add extra games, feel free to make an issue or a PR! (for the latter, remember that they MUST be in this hub: https://retroachievements.org/hub/22750)
